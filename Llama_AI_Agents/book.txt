Here is a 5-chapter book on Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE):

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Variational Quantum Eigensolver**

Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum algorithm that uses a classical optimization procedure to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. The VQE algorithm was first introduced in 2016 by John Preskill and others as a way to solve complex quantum chemistry problems using a variational approach.

In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of VQE, its motivations, and its applications. We will also discuss the main components of VQE: the Hamiltonian, the ansatz, and the optimization procedure.

**Introduction**

The study of many-body systems has been an active area of research in quantum physics for decades. However, as the size of these systems increases, the number of possible configurations grows exponentially, making it difficult to find exact solutions using classical computers. This is where VQE comes in.

VQE is a variational approach that uses a classical optimization procedure to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. The algorithm starts by assuming a specific form for the wave function, known as an ansatz, which is a linear combination of tensor products of single-particle states. The objective is to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to this ansatz.

**Motivations**

VQE was motivated by the need to solve complex quantum chemistry problems using a scalable and efficient algorithm. Quantum chemistry is a field that studies the behavior of atoms and molecules, which are composed of many particles interacting with each other. The study of these systems requires solving large-scale Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems, which can be challenging even for classical computers.

**Applications**

VQE has been applied to various quantum chemistry problems, including the calculation of molecular energies, spectroscopy, and chemical reactions. In particular, VQE has been used to study the behavior of molecules in different environments, such as solvents or magnetic fields.

In summary, VQE is a quantum algorithm that uses a classical optimization procedure to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. The algorithm starts by assuming a specific form for the wave function, known as an ansatz, which is a linear combination of tensor products of single-particle states.

**Chapter 2: Mathematical Details**

This chapter will delve into the mathematical details of VQE, including the definition of the Hamiltonian, the ansatz, and the optimization procedure.

**Hamiltonian**

The Hamiltonian is a central object in quantum physics that describes the energy of a system. In this context, the Hamiltonian is a Hermitian operator that represents the quantum many-body interaction.

For a system composed of N particles, the Hamiltonian can be written as:

H = ∑_{i=1}^N h_i (i)

where h_i (i) are single-particle operators that act on each particle separately.

**Ansatz**

The ansatz is a linear combination of tensor products of single-particle states. The form of the ansatz depends on the specific problem being solved, but it typically has the form:

ψ(x) = ∑_{i=1}^M α_i (x) | ψ_i(x)rangle

where α_i (x) are coefficients that depend on the input x, and | ψ_i(x)rangle are single-particle states.

**Optimization Procedure**

The optimization procedure is a classical algorithm that minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the ansatz. The procedure typically involves the following steps:

1. Initialize the coefficients α_i (x)
2. Evaluate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the ansatz
3. Update the coefficients α_i (x) using a optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent

The goal is to find the optimal values of α_i (x) that minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.

**Chapter 3: Practical Implementations**

This chapter will discuss practical implementations of VQE, including coding examples and simulations.

**Coding Example**

Here is a Python code example that implements VQE for a simple one-dimensional Ising model:
```python
import numpy as np

def ising_hamiltonian(x):
    # Define the single-particle operators
    h1 = 0.5 * (np.sum(x[:x.shape[0]//2]) + np.sum(-x[x.shape[0]//2:]))

    return -h1

# Define the ansatz
def ansatz(x, M=10):
    # Create a linear combination of tensor products of single-particle states
    ψ = np.zeros((M**3))
    for i in range(M**3):
        x_val = np.zeros_like(x)
        x_val[i % M, :] = np.exp(1j * 2 * np.pi * i / (M ** 2))
        ψ[i] = np.exp(-x_val @ x)

    return ψ

# Define the optimization procedure
def vqe(x, α, β):
    # Evaluate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the ansatz
    ψ = ansatz(x, M=10)
    hval = ising_hamiltonian(ψ * np.exp(-1j * α))
    return -hval

# Run the VQE algorithm
x = np.random.rand(M=10, N=M**3)  # Random initial state
α = np.random.rand(M=10)  # Initial coefficients
β = 0.01  # Optimization step size

for i in range(100):
    hval = vqe(x, α, β)
    α_new = α - hval * β
    x_new = x + (x - np.exp(-1j * α)) / 2
    α = α_new
    x = x_new

print("Final energy:", -hval)
```
This code implements a simple VQE algorithm for a one-dimensional Ising model, using a linear combination of tensor products of single-particle states as the ansatz. The optimization procedure uses gradient descent to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.
